# Steam for Linux Issue Tracker

This is the issue tracker for the Steam for Linux beta client.

## Reporting issues

If you encounter any bugs while using Steam for Linux or by playing any of the available Linux games, first search the [existing bug database](/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues) to see if it has already been reported.
If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

* a short, descriptive title;
* a detailed description of the bug, including any output from the command line;
* steps for reproducing the bug; and
* your system information*.

\* The easiest method way to get this information is to open Steam for Linux and go into `Help -> Hardware Information`. Once your information appears, right-click within the dialog and choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`. Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block.
