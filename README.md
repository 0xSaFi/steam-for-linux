Steam for Linux Issue Tracker
-----------------------------

This is the issue tracker for the Steam for Linux beta client.

Reporting issues
----------------

If you encounter any bugs while using Steam for Linux or by playing any of the available Linux games, first search the [existing bug database](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues) to see if it has already been reported.
If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the bug, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the bug; and
- your system information.\*

\* The easiest way to get this information is to open Steam for Linux and go into `Help -> Hardware Information` from the menu. Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`. Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block or in a [gist](https://gist.github.com).
